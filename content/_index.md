## What it is

_DB Browser for SQLite_ (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to
create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

DB4S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit
databases.  DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.

Controls and wizards are available for users to:

* Create and compact database files
* Create, define, modify and delete tables
* Create, define, and delete indexes
* Browse, edit, add, and delete records
* Search records
* Import and export records as text
* Import and export tables from/to CSV files
* Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files
* Issue SQL queries and inspect the results
* Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application
* Plot simple graphs based on table or query data

## What it is not

This program is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line tool, and does
not require familiarity with SQL commands. It is a tool to be used by both
developers and end users, and must remain as simple to use as possible
in order to achieve these goals.
