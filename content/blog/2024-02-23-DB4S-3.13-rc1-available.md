In anticipation of a full release later this year, we note that a release candidate of DB4S 3.13 is now available.
We expect this is the final form of the 3.13 release,
except for any bug fixes.

Get the 3.13.x-rc1 version from [https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.13.x-rc1](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.13.x-rc1)

The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
in the SQLiteBrowser Github repo describes the changes to this version.
